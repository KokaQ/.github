`kokaq` is a distributed, cloud-native priority queue implementation, designed to solve the long-standing gap of native priority handling in cloud messaging systems. It’s built for high availability, low latency, and intelligent resource allocation — empowering mission-critical workflows with dynamic, weight-based prioritization.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Fully open-source, extensible, and modular
- Native Cloud integration with pluggable backend storage
- REST and gRPC APIs
- SDKs for .NET, Python, JavaScript (coming soon)
- Designed for real-time ops, workflows, ML inference, and automation

## 📦 Roadmap

- [ ] Queue Engine with Weighted Priority Model
- [ ] Strict Priority-Based Dequeueing Algorithms
- [ ] gRPC and REST APIs
- [ ] Metrics Exporters (OpenTelemetry / Prometheus)
- [ ] SLA-aware Scheduling Engine
- [ ] SDKs and CLI tools
